An observation is a partial description of the state and some information may be missing.</p><p>Action: Different environments allow different kinds of actions, in a given environment, the set of effective actions is often called action space, including discrete action spaces and continuous action spaces, for example, if a maze walking robot only has four movement modes, it is a discrete action space; If the robot can move at any angle in 360◦, it is a continuous motion space.</p><p>Reward: A scalar feedback signal given by the environment that shows how well the agent has performed at a certain step in adopting a strategy</p><p>Essential Elements of Reinforcement Learning:</p><p>Reinforcement learning systems generally consist of four elements: policy, reward, value, and environment or modelPolicy</p><p>A policy defines the behavior of an agent for a given state, in other words, it is a mapping from state to behavior, in fact, the state includes the state of the environment and the state of the agent, here we start from the agent, that is, the state perceived by the agent. So we can know that policies are at the heart of reinforcement learning systems, because we can use policies to determine the behavior in each state. We summarize the characteristics of the strategy in the following three points:</p><ol><li><p>The policy defines the behavior of the agent</p></li><li><p>It is a mapping from state to behavior</p></li><li><p>The strategy itself can be a specific mapping or a random distribution</p></li></ol><p>Reward</p><p>Reward signals define the goal of the reinforcement learning problem, and at each time step, the scalar value emitted by the environment to reinforcement learning is the reward, which defines how well the agent behaves, similar to how happy or painful a human feels. Therefore, we can appreciate that the reward signal is the main factor influencing the strategy. We summarize the characteristics of the reward into the following three points:</p><ol><li><p>Reward is a scalar feedback signal</p></li><li><p>It can characterize how well an agent performs at a certain step</p></li><li><p>The task of the agent is to maximize the total reward value accumulated in a period of time</p></li></ol><p>Value</p><p>Next, let&#39;s talk about value, or value function, which is a very important concept in reinforcement learning, and unlike the immediacy of rewards, the value function is a measure of long-term benefits. We often say &quot;keep your feet on the ground and look up to the stars&quot;, and the evaluation of the value function is &quot;looking up to the stars&quot;, judging the benefits of current actions from a long-term perspective, not just staring at the immediate rewards. Combined with the purpose of reinforcement learning, we can clearly appreciate the importance of value function, in fact, for a long time, reinforcement learning research has focused on the estimation of value. We summarize the characteristics of the value function into the following three points:</p><ol><li><p>The value function is a prediction of future rewards</p></li><li><p>It can evaluate the quality of the state</p></li><li><p>The calculation of the value function requires the analysis of the transition between states</p></li></ol><p>Environment (Model)</p><p>Finally, let&#39;s talk about the external environment, that is, the model, which is a simulation of the environment, for example, when the state and behavior are given, with the model we can predict the next state and the corresponding reward. However, it is important to note that not all reinforcement learning systems need to have a model, so there are two different approaches: model-based and model-free, and the non-model-based approach is mainly through strategy and value function analysis. We summarize the characteristics of the model into the following two points:</p><ol><li><p>The model can predict the next performance of the environment</p></li><li><p>The specific performance can be reflected by the predicted state and reward</p></li></ol><p>Original link: <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45560318/article/details/112981006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45560318/article/details/112981006</a></p><h1 id="reinforcement-learning-classification" tabindex="-1">Reinforcement Learning Classification <a class="header-anchor" href="#reinforcement-learning-classification" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reinforcement Learning Classification&quot;">​</a></h1>',20),e("img",{src:r,"src-width":"987",class:"markdown-img m-auto","src-height":"511",align:"center"},null,-1),t(" Original link: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/466455380 "),e("p",null,"Model-Free does not understand the environment, but obtains information directly from the environment, Model-Based learns and understands the environment, learns to use a model to simulate the environment, and gets feedback through the simulated environment.
