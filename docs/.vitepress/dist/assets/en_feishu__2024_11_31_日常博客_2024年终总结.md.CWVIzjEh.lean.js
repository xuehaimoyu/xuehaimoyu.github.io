Unlike previous years, there is no complicated homework, no pressure to review, and there is no need to rush homework or review at 12:00 in the evening. Although the past 12 years have been like this New Year&#39;s Eve.</p><p>I was going to ask my friends to go to the beach to watch the first sunrise in 2025, but I was careless in making friends, either lazy or having or going to have a girlfriend, and because the boss asked if I was free to go on a business trip in January, I had to go to sub-zero Beijing in a few days, which led to the collapse of the plan to see the quadrant meteor shower, and I was stolen two takeaways in a row, and I didn&#39;t have the mood to watch the sunrise.</p><p>Or maybe I slept until next year after a long night, and I felt a little pity. So at 23:00, I began to record this year-end summary.</p><p>This year is an ordinary year in my life, but it is indeed the dividing line of growth, I was an undergraduate student in the first half of the year, and I became a doctoral student in the second half of the year, saying goodbye to my undergraduate roommates and living in a single room. It can be said that I started my doctoral career and really began to integrate into this society, and in just one semester, I deeply felt the gap between the academic ivory tower and the society.</p><p>Grabbing a dormitory is the first lesson, and there is a price to pay if you want to grab a single room.</p><p>Moving to the dormitory was the second lesson I was taught, and I was scolded by the moving uncle, and finally charged 70 yuan more.</p><p>Of course, I was happy to receive the first month&#39;s allowance and gratuity, and since then I no longer rely on my family, and I am truly financially independent.</p><p>I really felt my shallowness because I met with a senior brother in Pingshui, and I took a course on artificial intelligence ethics and the rule of law. He told the story of his jumping from mechanical to law, about being cheated by his master for thousands of dollars by his self-reliant selling account, and about his plan for the future. In the process of auditing, I was shocked by many things I had never heard of, the world I did not understand, and I deeply felt my own ignorance.</p><p>I finally remembered the most important reminder I had to myself, &quot;Weakness and ignorance are not obstacles to survival, arrogance is.&quot; ”</p><p>While it is fun to be a doctoral student, you must not let arrogance overshadow the most important thing – humility and respectful curiosity to explore the unknown.</p><p>Although the senior brother seems to be under a lot of pressure and hard work, it is really good, there is light in his eyes.</p><p>Becoming a scientist has always been my dream since I was a child, and getting a PhD has always been one of my life plans and goals.</p><p>Although the undergraduate has already felt the complexity of the academic world from some projects and defenses, for example, the defense results have nothing to do with the defense and thesis, and the interpersonal communication and hat of the supervisor are more related. But after all, there are some filters for engaging in academics.</p><p>The real fragmentation of the academic filter originated from the Mid-Autumn Festival, when I heard some rumors and started to do some chores, maybe I will write in detail after graduation in the future. In short, I really recognized some interpersonal relationships and learned an important lesson, &quot;Are you there?&quot; This kind of opening statement is the easiest to make people&#39;s blood pressure soar, there is no one, the boss can use it, and he must not use this to disgust others.</p><p>After that, I learned the first lesson of the doctorate: it is important to be cheerful and optimistic, and to have a positive attitude.Therefore, after getting my salary, I officially started my hobby of stargazing that had been in the dust for many years and started to look at the stars. Every time I look up at the night sky, I am always deeply shocked by its depth and vastness, and for the first time I can really see the craters on the surface of the moon through a telescope, see the rings of Saturn and the stripes of Jupiter, see the winter triangle, and see the Orion Nebula.</p><p>At the end of the semester, forcibly squeezing out two days to go to the beach to watch meteor showers and sunrises is the most worthwhile thing I have ever done since I entered school. One person makes a plan, and one person sets off with his bags and equipment on his back. When the meteor crossed the night sky, when the morning sun jumped out of the water, all the fatigue was swept away in that moment, and I just felt extremely moved.</p><p>Of course, this kind of emotion did not burn for a few days, and life taught me a vivid lesson. Shooting the stars downstairs, because my aunt didn&#39;t know the astronomical telescope and thought it was a bomb, I looked at each other with the police uncle and the security guard, and dramatically started to deal with the police for the first time in my life.</p><p>Of course, given that my aunt must have died earlier than me, I wouldn&#39;t be angry about such a trivial matter.</p><p>Writing this, I can&#39;t help but look forward to the thief who stole the takeaway to see the fake takeaway, and I Baidu for half an hour to believe in the results of the horror legend.</p><p>This is the end of the first semester of the PhD.</p><p>I didn&#39;t want to grow up, but I had to. Although I always wanted to be a real person, I had to start learning to wear all kinds of masks and start to learn to compromise.</p><p>People are going to die eventually, but what kind of life do you want to live?</p><p>When I was in elementary school, I felt that the campus was very large, but in junior high school, I felt that the campus was bigger, especially in high school, and now, I feel that the university campus, which is only ten times larger than high school, is very small. Kunming is a city that is like spring all year round, it is home, Shanghai is a bustling metropolis, intertwined with the past and the future, Beijing is the capital, shrouded in the haze and smoke of history, and Shenzhen is a young city that exudes vitality......</p><p>I&#39;ve traveled so many places and seen so many things, what kind of life do you want to live?</p><p>What&#39;s not to love about going? It&#39;s a pity that I haven&#39;t seen the majesty of the mountains; I have seen the majesty of the mountains, but I have not seen the vastness of the sea, and I still regret it; I have seen the vastness of the sea, but I have not seen the vastness of the desert, and I still regret it; I saw the vastness of the desert and never saw the mystery of the forest, which is still a pity.</p><p>The world is so big, I want to see it. I want to see different landscapes, I want to experience different experiences, I want to meet different people (it&#39;s a bit difficult to be afraid of society). I want to start a different journey.</p><p>Let&#39;s go, before the stars shine, let&#39;s go, before the long night is over, and if you don&#39;t hurry up, the day will come</p><p>Goodbye 2024, hello 2025. A new story begins.</p>",30)]))}const m=t(s,[["render",i]]);export{p as __pageData,m as default};
