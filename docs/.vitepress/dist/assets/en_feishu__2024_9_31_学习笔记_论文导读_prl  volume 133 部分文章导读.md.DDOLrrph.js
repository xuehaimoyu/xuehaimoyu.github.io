We show that the radially polarized laser pulses ensure that the seed electrons are present in the focal plane at the moment of highest amplitude, even in the case of extreme focusing.

However, this enhancement is usually limited to a very narrow area near the tipping point. Here, we systematically develop a modular approach to introduce multiple phase transitions in multibody systems. This naturally allows us to expand the region of quantum-enhanced precision by covering the newly created phase boundaries. Our method is universal and can be applied to symmetry-breaking and topological quantum sensors. In symmetry-breaking sensors, we show that newly created critical points inherit the original universal categories, and that simple measurements of total magnetization are sufficient to determine their position. In topology sensors, our modular construction creates multiple bands, resulting in a rich phase diagram. In both cases, the Heisenberg scaling estimated by the Hamiltonian parameter is achieved at all phase boundaries. This can be leveraged to create a global sensor that performs significantly better than a homogeneous probe.

However, the presence of quantum noise may undermine these advantages, blurring the boundaries of classical simulability. To further clarify this issue, we propose a novel polynomial-level method based on observable measurements of backpropagation path integral (OBPPP) on Pauli paths. In the presence of single-qubit Pauli noise, this method can effectively approximate the expected value of the operator in the variational quantum algorithm with a bounded truncation error. Theoretically, we rigorously prove: (i) For a constant minimum non-zero noise rate γ, the temporal and spatial complexity of the OBPPP is polynomially related to the number of qubits n and the circuit depth L. (ii) for variable noise rate γ, in the presence of more than two non-zero noise factors, the complexity remains Poly(n,L) if the γ is greater than 1/logL; However, when the γ is less than 1/L, the complexity increases exponentially with L. Numerically, we perform a classical simulation of the results of zero-noise extrapolation experiments on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor [Y. Kim et al., "Evidence of the Utility of Quantum Computing Before Fault Tolerance", Nature (London) 618, 500 (2023)). Compared to quantum devices, our method has demonstrated better performance in terms of accuracy and runtime. In addition, our method allows for the simulation of noise results, enabling accurate reproduction of IBM unmitigated experimental results that directly correspond to the original experimental observations. Our research reveals the critical role of noise in classical simulations, and the method is universal in calculating the expected value of a wide range of quantum circuits, which can be applied to the verification of quantum computers.`,-1),e("h3",{id:"efficient-characterization-of-qudit-logical-gates-with-gate-set-tomography-using-an-error-free-virtual-z-gate-mode",tabindex:"-1"},[a("Efficient Characterization of Qudit Logical Gates with Gate Set Tomography Using an Error-Free Virtual 𝑍 Gate Mode "),e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#efficient-characterization-of-qudit-logical-gates-with-gate-set-tomography-using-an-error-free-virtual-z-gate-mode","aria-label":'Permalink to "Efficient Characterization of Qudit Logical Gates with Gate Set Tomography Using an Error-Free Virtual 𝑍 Gate Mode"'},"​")],-1),e("p",null,"Efficient characterization of logic gates in multi-level systems using gateset tomography in error-free virtual Z-gate mode",-1),e("img",{src:s,"src-width":"500",class:"markdown-img m-auto","src-height":"423",align:"center"},null,-1),a(" Gate set tomography (GST) is used to characterize the process matrices of quantum logic gates, taking into account measurement and state preparation errors in quantum processors.

Our approach reduces the computational cost of estimating characterization results, making GST more practical on a larger scale.

Recent studies have explored the concept of certifying non-local associations over longer distances through local Bell testing. In this scheme, additional quantum devices are placed near one side, and short-range correlation is used to verify non-local behavior over long distances. However, existing studies either fail to address the issue of DIQKD security in this setting, especially for active attackers, or adopt methods that do not give a tight bounds on the key rate. In this study, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate calculation task in this setting, combined with the most recent methods used to analyze standard DIQKD. With this approach, we show that if the short-range device has a sufficiently high detection efficiency, it is possible to achieve a positive key rate at a lower detection efficiency in long-distance branches than with a standard DIQKD setup. This highlights the potential of DIQKD to improve its performance at long distances in scenarios where short-range correlations are used to verify quantum correlations.
