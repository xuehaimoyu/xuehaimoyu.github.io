Whatever you have arrived belongs to yesterday. No matter how green the mountain is, how beautiful the water is, and how gentle the wind is. Lingering too deep becomes a kind of bond, stumbling not only on the feet, but also on the future. What's not to love going? It's a pity that I haven't seen the majesty of the mountains; I have seen the majesty of the mountains, but I have not seen the vastness of the sea, and I still regret it; I have seen the vastness of the sea, but I have not seen the vastness of the desert, and I still regret it; I saw the vastness of the desert and never saw the mystery of the forest, which is still a pity. There are endless landscapes in the world, and I am in the mood of not getting old. Naturally, I know that the mountains have ups and downs, the sea has waves, the deserts have winds and sands, and the forests have beasts of prey. Even so, I still like it. Breaking the peace of life is another scene, a scene that belongs to youth. I'm glad I'm not old yet. Even if you are really old, what if you are really old, isn't there a saying that old age is stronger? Therefore, I still want to learn profundity from the mountains, I also want to learn courage from the sea, I also want to learn composure from the desert, and I also want to learn agility from the forest. I want to learn to taste a colorful life. How far can a person go? This is not to ask about the feet, but about the ambition; How high can a person climb? It's not about the hands, it's about the will. Therefore, I want to use the enthusiasm of youth to set a lofty goal for myself. Not only to strive for a kind of glory, but also to pursue a kind of realm. When the goal is achieved, it is glorious; If the goal cannot be achieved, life will be enriched and fulfilled by this journey of ups and downs; In my opinion, this is a worthwhile life. Yes, I love to go, and I hope you like it too.")],-1),e("p",null,"There's a footprint map here.",-1)]))}const c=o(r,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,c as default};
