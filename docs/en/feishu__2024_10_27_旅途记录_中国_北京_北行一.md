# Northbound 1

<img src="/assets/J6YvbbjlLoQZW9xMONuculcZnld.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>
The first line in Beijing, but it's not, I have been to junior high school once, but I am not impressed, you might as well take this time in May 2024 as the first time.

## Pan Homestead

The first stop of the trip, on the day of arriving in Beijing, there was a ghost market in Panjiayuan (why is it called a ghost market), so I hit it off with my old friends and ran all the way from Xicheng District to Panjiayuan to find out.

As a place that often appears in novels, Panjiayuan is always shrouded in a veil of mystery, the largest fake market in the country, and a gathering place for all kinds of scams and porcelain, which makes people want to open their eyes.

But when I arrived, I found that it had obviously been transformed into a small commodity wholesale market with similar obligations, although there are still some interesting things, such as meteorites, but after all, there are some regrets, although there are many people, the atmosphere is not as good as Shanghai's second-hand book market or community flea market.

## Tsinghua University

If you can't pass the exam, you have to come and see, thanks to your friends, you can get a glimpse of it on the day of the school anniversary.

<img src="/assets/Uze6b6UkXoTCcGx5kaJcqbjvnLf.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

It is worthy of being one of the first universities in the country, and there are souvenirs sold everywhere at the door, unlike a certain Ji University in Shanghai, although it is near Wujiaochang with a certain Dan, there are only vendors selling a certain Dan souvenirs nearby.

Shuimu Tsinghua is indeed a scenic spot, and the moonlight of the lotus pond is indeed famous.

Tsinghua's black swan

<img src="/assets/I35JbCN6zoUNRexf9tHcEu7Znxo.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>The legendary principal's courtyard, the same nature as the White Tiger Hall, was opened for school anniversary.

In short, it is a very quaint campus, I am both regretful and glad that I was not admitted here, although there is no legendary beginning, but life in a certain Ji is still relatively relaxed, fulfilling and happy.

## Beijing Language and Culture University

<img src="/assets/OJdFbRSoJoKJGCxfXGXcSPw4nug.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>
Thanks to my sister, I went to Beijing Language and Culture University to experience a garden party, although I didn't do anything, I was dumped halfway, and I invited her to have a meal in the evening, but it was quite interesting.

## Old Summer Palace

The Old Summer Palace is right next to Qingbei, just like the back garden of the two families.

<img src="/assets/UD8xbBq7HoPHy2xyPzoclg1fntc.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

The beacon fire has dissipated, and the dust of history has drifted through the years, leaving only the stones and the weeds in the cracks of the stones.

<img src="/assets/IoqBbKCeLooNZcx3OyYcTuVMnOb.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

What was once a royal garden has now become a place for tourists to take pictures and check in, and the years have passed in this way.

(However, it is not good to charge tickets separately in this area)

Small scenes along the way, saturation warriors.

## Trip to the central axis

The plan is the Temple of Earth-Tiananmen-Temple of Heaven, but when you get to Tiananmen, you really can't walk. So there was a trip to the semi-central axis.

### Temple of Earth

The Temple of Earth does not have the fame of the Temple of Heaven, so naturally there is no passenger flow of the Temple of Heaven, and it is a good place to stroll and relax. Standing on the highest platform, feeling the cold wind, imagining the solemn and heavy sacrifice scene, I can't help but sigh that the ancients were in good health.

<img src="/assets/DsPmbmsvLokklBx9rADc92bSnGd.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="2133" align="center"/>

The once sacrificial place has now completely become a people's park, watching the uncles and aunts sing and dance, so lively.

<img src="/assets/BWE9bMI7yoLRj5xIwSGcJaEQn4L.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

The small flowers on the eaves are very distinctive.

<img src="/assets/N6ZXbLHehoOKHbxNq2XciynanHd.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>
The emperor's room is located opposite the altar of the earth, the emperor's room is located on the south side of the Fang Ze altar, it is the temple of the emperor's land, Wuyue, five towns, Wuling Mountain, the four seas, and the four blasphemy gods (the Qing Dynasty added the first six saints of this dynasty), every time the "summer solstice" is worshiped by Fang Ze, the gods are invited to the altar by the Ministry of Rites and placed on the corresponding god seat, and after the sacrifice is completed, please return to this temple to worship, every first and fifteenth day of the new year by the officials of Taichang Temple come here to pay homage.

<img src="/assets/Gt21bLvLUoKPzYx94rwcEkfunyb.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>All kinds of etiquette, myths, and legends in ancient China are really fascinating, but it is a pity that there are very few people who are willing to introduce, disseminate, and understand, and everyone seems to be busy, and those who are busy have no time to meditate and experience life.

If it weren't for the constraints of reality, I might have become an adventurer.

## Taixue Guozijian

Heading south, head to Taixue, passing through various alleys.

<img src="/assets/Sy5DbRCFfoWRtAxx3gvc4Uq8nvg.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="2133" align="center"/>

Walking through the streets and alleys, you can deeply feel the weight of Beijing's history, and all kinds of courtyards and courtyards are square and square, although they are slightly dilapidated, but they can also emit golden light by virtue of their geographical location.

<img src="/assets/LXIub8uD2oMYWlxUQsXcU7MHnWd.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="2133" align="center"/>

The monument seen on the road, the officials and people are waiting to dismount here, in order to show respect? Or to prevent congestion at the door?

<img src="/assets/JykRbCOXWoWYUfxuupKc41zlnCd.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="2133" align="center"/>

The torii of the country.

<img src="/assets/F6WCbPvWdoKoNox9K7QcKG16nZb.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="2133" align="center"/>

Taixue is much more lively than the Temple of Earth, and it's always good to have a lively time and be literate. Of course, the souvenirs also look good.

Although the Holy Teacher, the founder of Confucian culture, is more than 2,000 years behind today, his ideas can still influence today, and in my opinion, this is as remarkable an achievement as a major breakthrough in physics. Time is the standard of inspection, and proposing something that can be passed down for thousands of years is really our idol.

Pray to the Doctor Hall, I hope I finish my PhD safely.

## Jingshan

Continue to walk south, on the way to Jingshan, by the way, I ate half a Peking duck by myself (it's a bit weird to go down to the restaurant alone), it's delicious, but the roast duck has always been delicious.

<img src="/assets/SVDfbOnihoIqrCxMpz9cJCipnkf.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

In history, Chongzhen fled to Jingshan, hanged himself, and thought that Jingshan was a big mountain, but the hill was verdant, and the peonies under the mountain were in full bloom, but it also deserved the name of the scenery.

<img src="/assets/L7ChbOI3Fo7bBOxK8mFcVe8znsf.png" src-width="1600" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="2133" align="center"/>

Peonies in Jingshan Park. Peony? Mother single! When I wrote this, I suddenly pierced my heart, and I took a lot of photos, but let's put one of them.

<img src="/assets/EsL6bfqfsouTa4x8cMccXGamnTg.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

Looking at the Forbidden City from Jingshan, although Jingshan is small, you can still see the Forbidden City at a glance.

## Tiananmen

Coming down from Jingshan, I couldn't walk, and I was ready to ride, but I didn't find it along the way, so I went from Jingshan to Tiananmen Square, and achieved the achievement of circumnavigating the Forbidden City half a circle.

A small pavilion in the moat

Tiananmen

The first time I set foot on Tiananmen Square in the capital, I was full of emotion, and 1,000 words are omitted here.

The security check is very strict, and the security police lady is very surprised that I am alone.

It is worthy of the capital, except for Tiananmen Square, there are so many buildings around the ticket that I didn't grab.

Monument to the People's Heroes at night

This is the center of politics, and I deeply feel the weight of history and the insignificance of individuals.

It's spectacular, it's just too cold.

## Houhai

The last night was in Houhai and the walk along the lake was very beautiful.

<img src="/assets/Up2dbSxtQoIvvmxY4wjcQEkVngd.png" src-width="2133" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

It's a little scary, and during the walk, the proprietress of the bar is crazy to solicit customers, and she can't get rid of it.

## Postscript

Enough rest, it's time to get back on the road
