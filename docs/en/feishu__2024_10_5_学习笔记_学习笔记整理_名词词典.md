### Local unitary transition

In quantum information science, local unitary transformation and unitary transformation are related but distinct concepts.

1. **Unitary Transformation**: A unitary transform is a linear transformation that keeps the inner product constant, satisfying \( U^\dagger U = I \), where \( U^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( U \) and \( I \) is the identity matrix. Unitary transformations typically act on the state space of the entire quantum system, and therefore may alter the global properties of the system.

1. Local Unitary Transform: The local unitary transform refers to the unitary transformation that is applied to each subsystem of a composite quantum system. For a quantum state \( \rho) consisting of two subsystems, the local unitary transform is usually expressed as \( U = U_A \otimes U_B \), where \( U_A \) and \( U_B \) are unitary operators acting on each subsystem, respectively. The local unitary transformation does not change the degree of entanglement between the two subsystems, because it only acts on the local degrees of freedom of each subsystem and does not affect the association between them.

distinguish

- **Different ranges**: The general unitary transform acts on the entire system, while the local unitary transform only acts on the individual subsystems of the system.
- Entanglement invariance: The local unitary transform does not change the entanglement properties of the quantum state, while the global unitary transform may change the degree of entanglement of the system.
- 
Local unitary transformations are important in quantum information processing because they are often used to analyze the equivalence of quantum states (i.e., equivalence in the sense of entanglement).

### permutations of the parties? ï¼‰In a multi-party quantum system, the displacement of the parties of the system refers to the rearrangement or exchange of the various subsystems (or "squares") that make up the composite quantum state. For example, for a system containing three qubits $A$, $B$, and $C$, the roles of qubits A and B can be swapped to obtain a state in a different permutation. Mathematically, this can be achieved by applying the Permutation Operator.

The significance of the substitution of all parties in the system

1. Symmetry Analysis: By displacing the parties, the symmetry properties of quantum states can be studied. For example, for a particular permutation, if the quantum state remains constant, the state is symmetric, which is important in studying the structure of entangled states as well as in applications such as quantum communication.

1. Entanglement Properties: In multi-party quantum systems, the structure of entanglement may change with the displacement of subsystems. By studying the possible permutations, it is possible to examine the distribution of entanglements between different parties or subsystems. This is very helpful for understanding the entanglement mode of quantum states and judging the type of entanglement.

1. Basis Transform: In quantum computing or measurement, quantum states can be converted into bases that are easy to analyze by displacing parties. Sometimes a particular arrangement can simplify the calculation or facilitate the observation of the properties of the state.

An example of a system of substitutions by parties

Suppose we have a composite state \( \rho_{ABC} \) that contains three subsystems: \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). Displacing the system changes the state to \( \rho_{BAC} \) or \( \rho_{CAB} \), where the subscript now represents a new arrangement of the subsystem. In matrix representations, this is equivalent to rearranging the elements of the density matrix, or applying the corresponding permutation matrix.

In practice, displacement can be achieved through a swap operation, usually using a controlled-swap gate, or by re-indexing density matrix elements. This is especially useful when comparing different permutations of quantum states, especially in quantum entanglement studies, where different permutations may reveal different types of associations between subsystems.

### Spin correlation matrix

In quantum information and quantum mechanics, the Spin Correlation Matrix, often denoted as \( T \), describes the correlation between the spins of individual particles in a multi-particle system. The spin correlation matrix is a partial matrix of the density matrix, which captures the entangled structure and classical correlation properties of multi-particle systems, and is especially useful in describing two-qubit systems.

Definition of the spin correlation matrix \( T \).

For a two-qubit system, its density matrix \( \rho \) can be expanded by the tensor product of the Pauli matrix as:

$$\rho = \frac{1}{4} \left( I \otimes I + \sum_{i} a_i \sigma_i \otimes I + \sum_{j} b_j I \otimes \sigma_j + \sum_{i,j} T_{ij} \sigma_i \otimes \sigma_j \right)$$

Thereinto:

- $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$ represent Pauli matrices, which respectively describe the components of the spin in different directions.
- $a_i$ and $b_i$ are components that describe the spin polarization of a single particle (qubit).
- $T_{ij}$ is an element of the spin correlation matrix, which reflects the spin correlation of two qubits in all directions. Specifically, $( T_{ij} = \text{Tr}(\rho\sigma_i \otimes \sigma_j) )$, where 

A 3*3 real matrix of spin correlation matrices, where each element $T_{ij}$ describes the spin correlation of the first qubit in the i direction and the second qubit in the j direction.

The significance of spin correlation matrices

1. Entanglement Determination: Spin correlation matrices can be used to analyze the entanglement characteristics of a system. For example, for two fully entangled particles, such as the Bell state, the T-matrix exhibits a specific symmetrical structure.
2. Quantum state characterization: In quantum computing and quantum information processing, the spin correlation matrix T helps to describe the state of a composite quantum system. For example, the \( T \) matrix makes it easy to compute the correlation function of two qubits to quantify their quantum correlation strength.
3. Quantum Channel Analysis: When studying quantum channels or quantum operations, T-matrices can help us understand the transport properties and interactions of quantum states between different qubits.
