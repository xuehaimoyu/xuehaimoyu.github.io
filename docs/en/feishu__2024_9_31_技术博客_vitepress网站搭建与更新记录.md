# Vitepress Blog Building Record

## 2024.10.30 

Finally, the basic framework was successfully built. It's not easy to use Feishu as the foundation of your blog.

At present, it is mainly dependent on https://github.com/ftyszyx/feishu-vitepress to export articles, then update the sidebar and translate it into English, realize the translation between Chinese and English, copy the exported assets to the current folder, and update the sidebar in config.mts (ps: a bit stupid, but at least it works)

The construction of the main framework mainly depends on the https://vitepress.yiov.top/

Current implementations include Mathjax rendering, Feishu-like subpage layouts, and automatic deployment every time you push to GitHub.

Follow-up features to be realized:

1. Footprint map.

2. Comment system.

3、live2d。

4. Better looking page layout.

At present, the overall blog is still being migrated
