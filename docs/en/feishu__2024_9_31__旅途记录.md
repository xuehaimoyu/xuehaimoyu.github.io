# Travelogue

> I love to go.

> Whatever you have arrived belongs to yesterday. No matter how green the mountain is, how beautiful the water is, and how gentle the wind is. Lingering too deep becomes a kind of bond, stumbling not only on the feet, but also on the future.

> What's not to love going? It's a pity that I haven't seen the majesty of the mountains; I have seen the majesty of the mountains, but I have not seen the vastness of the sea, and I still regret it; I have seen the vastness of the sea, but I have not seen the vastness of the desert, and I still regret it; I saw the vastness of the desert and never saw the mystery of the forest, which is still a pity. There are endless landscapes in the world, and I am in the mood of not getting old.

> Yes, I love to go, and I hope you like it too.

After going to so many places, you have to leave some records, and QQ albums are just photos, hoping to pick up and record the past and future journeys through blogs.

Footprint maps to be added.

Slowly migrating updates.
