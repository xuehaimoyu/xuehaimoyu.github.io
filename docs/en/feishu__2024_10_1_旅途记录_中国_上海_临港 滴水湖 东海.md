# Shanghai. Lingang. Dishui Lake. East China Sea

Here's some of the journey before setting up a blog.

East China Sea

## Introduction

The Lingang area is located at the eastern end of Shanghai and is closely connected to the sea. When you arrive in Shanghai, a seaside city, how can you not go to the beach to see it?

Because I like it, I've been there three times so far.

In my opinion, the easiest way to travel in Shanghai is subway + sharing bicycle, rail transit line 16, direct to Lingang Dishui Lake. Line 16 starts from Longyang Road subway station and ends at Dishui Lake, especially the big station cars and direct trains, which undoubtedly saves a lot of time to Dishui Lake.

In particular, it is worth mentioning that the natural scenery along Line 16 is also very beautiful, especially if the time is chosen around the setting of the sun, you can experience the charm of a twilight train.

## Drip Lake

Dishui Lake is a large artificial lake, which looks like a perfect circle from the map, but after the actual inspection, the edge is actually not a perfect circle.

Next to Dishui Lake is a man-made walking and cycling trail, compared to the west side near the subway station, which is more prosperous. Fishing is forbidden for the sake of the lake, but cycling or walking around the lake is a pleasure, but bicycles are a bit hard to find. But cycling around the lake is very pleasant. In contrast, there are fewer people in winter than in summer, and this expanse of nature is intoxicating, completely unstressing and freeing yourself.

## On the way

From Dishui Lake, follow the map, and there are many paths leading to the shores of the East China Sea.

There are also many surprises on the trail, such as the tributaries of Dishui Lake, the occasional fishing for shrimp, and the magnificent rape fields. Meituan can also deliver food. (This is a real cow)

Rape flower fields

In the lonely autumn, the sense of wilderness will bring more flavor.

The road is wild

Using a drone to travel through the wilderness, I inexplicably have the feeling of chasing a cornfield at the beginning of the movie Interstellar.

## Donghai Nanhuizui

Nanhuizui Guanhai Park is located on the coast of the East China Sea, a very beautiful sea-viewing park.

There is a hotel nearby, which is cheap in the off-season, and it is a sea view room, and you can go out to see the sea and the stars at night.

However, it is best to stay in company during the off-season, because there is no one nearby, and meals can only be eaten in hotels, and every meal is expensive.

At night, Nanhuizui, behind is the lights of the Donghai Bridge, stretching all the way to the misty sea, forming a misty and beautiful boundary, and the lighthouse will also flash and flash, reflecting the starry sky in the sky.<img src="/assets/Mb26bSsyEoWd4bx2ez2cY6d1nzb.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

Next to the park is the East China Sea.

When you come to Shanghai, how can you not see the sea?

Although it is a pity, due to the pollution of the Yangtze River, the water here is also yellow.

East China Sea

Out of the hotel is the East Sea Embankment, a long straight road that can not be seen as far as the end can be, corresponding to the East Sea Bridge.

There were several kilometers of road, and when we went, there were no people in sight.

The sea breeze is blowing, strolling on the embankment, and the heart is relaxed.

Walk along the embankment, cross the Donghai Bridge, and you will arrive at Windmill Bay.
