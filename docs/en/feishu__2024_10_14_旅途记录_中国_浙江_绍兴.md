> Jiangnan water town with outstanding people

Shaoxing, outstanding people, located in Huiji Shanyin, the historical specialty is the master.

In the 11th Golden Week of the crowd, such a relatively niche and rich in the atmosphere of Jiangnan water town is undoubtedly a good place to go.

## Journey

From Shanghai, it takes only a few hours to get to Shaoxing by high-speed train, and all the way is a vast plain, which is very novel and interesting for people like me who are used to seeing the mountains.

Exterior view of the high-speed rail

I like to take the high-speed rail to set off, the scenery and climate changes along the way, so that the whole journey is vivid and interesting, and sometimes the roadside scenery is more interesting than many scenic spots.

## Anchang Ancient Town

### Ancient town day

As a famous ancient town in Shaoxing, Anchang Ancient Town is located in the northwest of Shaoxing City, not too far from the high-speed rail station, we will take this as the first stop of our visit to Shaoxing, and rest for a night at the inn in the center of the ancient town. The traditional water town of Anchang has a strong atmosphere, with buildings on both sides of the river built along the river, black canopy boats flowing endlessly, and the roads along the coast are full of people setting up stalls, and specialty snacks are dizzying.

Find the proprietress of the accommodation to buy tickets for some of the scenic spots, which are cheaper than those sold outside. The local rice wine popsicle is a must, and the taste is very tempting. But for the local specialties, I can't appreciate it, the salt is full of flavor, and the sauce is very peculiar. Of course, when it comes to Shaoxing, it is naturally inseparable from fennel beans, but it is really a peculiar taste, and I am sick after buying a bag. However, speaking of Shaoxing, in my opinion, rice wine popsicles are very delicious, and there are people selling them everywhere on the street, which is impressive.

The ancient town of Anchang

As a traditional ancient town in the south of the Yangtze River, Anchang Ancient Town is built along the river, with antique architecture, and has a different historical charm compared with the Xiongguang Mandao in the north.<img src="/assets/B8Zsb2ZYMoJLG7x2Ie3cMoCjnlf.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

As an important part of traditional Chinese novels, the City God Temple is also indispensable here, and this is the first time I have visited the City God Temple. In addition to charging tickets, it still has a magical atmosphere.

Master's introduction hall

Master Shaoxing has also left many legends in history, such as Xu Wenchang.

Renchang Sauce Garden

The sauce is the specialty here, the bizarre taste, every local specialty, but I can't eat it.

The inside is deep

The ancient town is not big, but it is full of life.

### Night view of the ancient town

The night view of Anchang Ancient Town is also quite distinctive, and the lights on the side of the road illuminate the entire river.

At night, there are balloons and rings near the entrance, which I haven't seen for a long time.

In the ancient town, you can also see some magical things on the stalls, such as martial arts cheats bound with yellowed paper, and all kinds of Taoist charms, although I know that it is a lie, but a few dollars to buy a Lehe is still very good, in case.

Warm a glass of boiling water, come to a fennel bean (too unpalatable), I can't help but sigh, this is life.

## Keyan Scenic Area

Starting from the ancient town, there is still a long drive to Keyan, but it is all outside the city. This sentence is nonsense, if you are not outside the city, where can you make such a large natural landscape.

Hotels near Keyan are more expensive, but you can save a lot of money by choosing an express hotel outside the scenic area. Of course, the Keyan Scenic Area also has to charge tickets. However, student ID cards can be discounted, especially by boat. Although there are some places in the design of the scenic spot that are more black-hearted, it can be seen that the mind has been put into it, but as long as you pay careful attention and are willing to walk, there is still a way, which is not mentioned for the time being.

Keyan Scenic Area is one of my favorite attractions to travel to Shaoxing, although I heard that it is an artificial scenic spot, but the layout design is still eye-catching. There are mountains and rivers and the scenery is pleasant. The water of Jianhu Lake is much cleaner than the water of the ancient town, if the ancient town of Anchang makes people feel the tradition of the water towns in the south of the Yangtze River, the Keyan Scenic Area can feel the beauty of the water towns in the south of the Yangtze River even more.

Keyan Scenic Area mainly includes three major scenic spots: Keyan, Luzhen and Jianhu

Ke Yan looks at the stones, Jianhu looks at the water, and Luzhen looks at the people.

Starting from Keyan, play all the way to Jianhu Lake, and finally take a boat to Luzhen.

### Ke Yan

For the stone culture, the culture is limited, and it is difficult for me to appreciate it.

However, there is a Puzhao Temple that has stopped for a long time, and there are paintings of the story of the birth of the Buddha in the temple.

Walking in the Keyan Scenic Area, there are many small lakes, lakes and mountains, and clear pond water, which complement each other with small buildings

This is Gangnam

### Jianhu

If the Keyan Scenic Area is one of my favorite scenic spots in Shaoxing, then Jianhu Lake is undoubtedly my favorite part of the Keyan Scenic Area.

There is a scenic spot in Jianhu Lake, according to conventional means, you can only spend money to go by boat, ask the staff, and only euphemistically tell you can go more.

Carefully study the map, near the edge of the scenic spot, there is a small road leading to the scenic spot, and you can take a boat for free, do not waste the canopy boat ticket bought at the door around the lake, but you need to go a long way.<img src="/assets/YxX9bJFeeoC9AMx8Ceec6qAanSf.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

Money-saving roads (skip the cost of a boat ride to the island)

<img src="/assets/Q9Zvb6gZgo8JynxZ2fsc88cgnPg.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

But Jianhu Lake is really beautiful.

<img src="/assets/XjFfbK0mgoSwtKxFdqscwOY5nuh.png" src-width="1960" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1599" align="center"/>

Even if I made up the memory the day after tomorrow, when I saw the photos, I also recalled the beautiful scenery of Jianhu Lake.

<img src="/assets/CUG1b35DOoumM6x3XYGcYoTXnvf.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

It is still the beautiful Jianhu Lake

### Lu Town

Speaking of Shaoxing, I have to mention Lu Xun, as a textbook text, Mr. Lu Xun's articles have always been thoughtful, even if there is a tree here, there is also a tree over there" such a sentence, it is also very worthy of appreciation, the article is profound, but the exam is realistic, there is a fixed answer to the reading comprehension, the end is magical, now it seems that students are not creative, even literary reading must have the same thinking, stop laughing.

After getting off the canopy boat, we arrived at Lu Town

Although it is only the name of the place in the novel, it still spent a lot of money to build this tourist town.

Although it is reproduced according to the text, the various scenes still have the feeling of reappearing in the past, and I have a heart.

I still remember the stage of social drama, Xianheng Hotel, Kong Yiji owes a few pennies again.

<img src="/assets/TpFAbklulox7rBxGcKBcXSnznOh.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/S3Y8bVYwfoFKA1xpaaIcFBJrnTb.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

The stage, probably must be the social drama.

<img src="/assets/R8UPb87WioCa2Uxgn1Qcvk3anTh.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

Xianheng Hotel, the unpalatable fennel beans are still vivid.

<img src="/assets/OOwTbE2vQopXulxbTDccyktEnmh.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

However, it is worth mentioning that as long as the time is well controlled, you can watch the sunset in Luzhen.

<img src="/assets/N04Ab1IhCo1WonxcBqgc4Snln0f.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>No matter how many times I watch it, the sunrise and sunset, the stars always give me a deep shock.

## Rantei

In the ninth year of Yonghe, the age is ugly, and at the beginning of the twilight spring, he will be in the Lanting of Huiji Shanyin, and he will repair things. The sages are complete, and the young are salty. There are lofty mountains and mountains here, lush forests and bamboos; There is also a clear stream turbulent, reflecting the left and right, leading to the flow of the winding water, and the column sits second. Although there is no silk bamboo orchestra, a song is enough to tell the romance.

But to be honest, the Lanting attractions are only more expensive than the Lanting Collection.

However, it can be seen that the Shaoxing government has put a lot of effort into it, whether it is the cultural creativity or the subtle design, it has a relatively delicate intention, which is very interesting in my opinion. There is also a museum.

It's a pity that the time is limited, and I only go around the park, and I can't climb Huiji Mountain to see the feelings of the literati.

<img src="/assets/VYDcbd2hgorrVuxG0Ulc7wiKnTg.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>

It is said to be Rantei

<img src="/assets/E0uybnTJKomk8NxKkMgcANhLnSc.png" src-width="2048" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1536" align="center"/>
Huiji Mountain

But I'm too lazy to spend time on pen and ink, and I still prefer natural scenes.

Of course, the main thing is that I am too lazy to write, and I am still very happy to entertain myself.

## Postscript

The trip to Shaoxing is probably like this.

Attach a postscript written earlier

The world is so big that it is difficult to describe it in a word, and the beauty of the scenery is impossible to see without visiting in person.

However, traveling all over the world, the deceased is like this, and the memory will eventually be turned into fragments and forgotten, so it will be remembered as a travel record.
