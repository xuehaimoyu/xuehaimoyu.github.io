# Advanced Quantum Mechanics Study Notes

Referring to excerpts from Mr. WZG's lecture notes on advanced quantum mechanics and other materials, only part of the content is collated, mainly related to quantum computing, and is only used for my own learning. Part of the answer is from chatgpt, although I think it makes a lot of sense and has been modified a bit, but it is just for reference.

## 1 Fundamental Theory of Quantum Mechanics

### 1.1 Basics

Schrödinger equation for the time evolution of the wave function:

$$\mathrm{i}\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\mathrm{t}}=\widehat{H}\psi$$

1. The Schrödinger equation fully describes the time evolution of the state function.

2. The state function satisfying the Schrödinger equation satisfies the superposition principle.

### 1.2 Representation Theory

Just as we use Cartesian coordinate system or curvilinear coordinate system to study different problems in classical physics, in quantum mechanics, the appropriate choice of "coordinate system" will greatly simplify the problem solving process. To this end, Dirac proposed the concept of the state wave function as a vector of the Hilbert space of multi-dimensional linear vectors, that is, the theory of numerical wave functions on the basis of expressing the space composed of the independent variables of the wave function of the system—the representation theory. The normalized eigenfunction system corresponding to the different eigenvalues of any Hermitian operator can form a suitable set of Hilbert space basis vectors, so as to give the corresponding specific representations of states and mechanical quantities in quantum mechanics.

In order to quantitatively characterize states and mechanical quantities, we usually construct a Hilbert space with the eigenfunction system of a certain mechanical quantity as the basis vector. The method of constructing a Hilbert space from the eigenfunction system of mechanical quantities is called representation.

#### 1.2.1 Representation transformation

There are two representations:

I appearance: that is, the Hilbert space of the system is based on the eigenstate $|i\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalues $i$ that satisfy the eigenequation $\hat{I}|i\rangle=i|i\rangle$ of the mechanical quantities of the eigenequation $\hat{I}|i\rangle=i|i\rangle$, that is, there is an orthogonal normalization condition $\langle i|j\rangle=\delta_{ij}$ and a completeness condition $\sum_i|i\rangle\langle i|=1$.

M appearance: that is, the Hilbert space of the system is based on the eigenstate $|m\rangle$ corresponding to the eigenvalues of the eigenequation $\hat{M}|m\rangle=m|m\rangle$ that satisfies the eigenequation $\hat{M}|m\rangle=m|m\rangle$, which satisfies the eigenvalues, that is, there is an orthogonal normalization condition $\langle m|n\rangle=\delta_{mn}$ and a completeness condition $\sum_m|m\rangle\langle m|=1$.

Then, a certain eigenstate of the mechanical quantity $|m\rangle$ is represented in the I representation as:

$|m\rangle=\sum_i|i\rangle\langle i|m\rangle=\sum_iS_{im}|i\rangle$(insert a 1)$S_{im}=\langle i|m\rangle$ is the component of the base vector of the M representation on the base vector of the I representation. The projection of all the base vectors of the M representation on all the base vectors of the I representation constitutes the representation transformation matrix.

The arbitrary state of the system (arbitrary vector) $|a\rangle$ can be represented in the I representation as:

$$|a\rangle=\sum_i|i\rangle\langle i|a\rangle$$

It can also be represented as in the M representation

$$|a\rangle=\sum_m|m\rangle\langle m|a\rangle$$

so

$$\langle m|a\rangle=\sum_i\langle m|i\rangle\langle i|a\rangle=\sum_iS_{im}^*\langle i|a\rangle=\sum_iS_{mi}^\dagger\langle i|a\rangle$$

The matrix represents: $a_M=S^\dagger a_I$

For operator T, you want to convert it from an I representation to an M representation.

$$T_{mn}=\langle m|T|n\rangle=\sum_{i,j}\langle m|i\rangle\langle i|\hat{T}|j\rangle\langle\mathrm{i}|n\rangle=\sum_{i,j}S_{im}^* T_{ij}S_{jn}=\sum_{i,j}S_{mi}^+ T_{ij}S_{ jn}$$

$$T_M=S^\dagger T_I S$$

Properties of Representational Transformation:

1. Do not change the eigenvalues of the matrix

2. Do not change the trace of the matrix

3. Do not change the relationship between reciprocity and exchange.

### 1.3 Two-state system qubits

A qubit is a quantum system with two independent manipulators of quantum states. These two quantum states are each labeled as $| 0\rangle ,| 1\rangle$

The principle of superposition of states in quantum mechanics, qubits can be in any superposition of these two states:

$$|\psi\rangle=cos\frac\theta2|1\rangle+sin\frac\theta2e^{i\phi}|0\rangle$$

Such a quantum state can be conveniently represented by a Bloch sphere, as shown in Figure 1. A Bloch sphere is a unit sphere that is often used to represent the quantum states of a two-level system.

<img src="/assets/VaNbbNvSComnnYxh0Qxc0RNfndY.png" src-width="550" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="597" align="center"/>
For example, if the two fundamental states of a qubit are labeled $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ respectively, then any state of a qubit can be represented by two complex numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as:

$$|\psi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$$

Correspondingly, the physical quantity operators can be represented as 2×2 matrices in two-dimensional Hilbert space. Obviously, any Hermitian operator can be expressed as:

$$\begin{pmatrix}q+z&x-iy\\x+iy&q-z\end{pmatrix}=q\mathbb{I}+x\sigma_x+y\sigma_y+z\sigma_z$$For the state of a qubit, when neither $\alpha$ nor $\beta$ is 0, we say that it is in a superposition of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. This means that if a system can be in both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, then it can also be in any $\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$, and such a state is called a "superposition". Here $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be taken as any number, and the only restriction on them is that the normalization condition requires that the sum of the squares of their absolute values be equal to 1, i.e., $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$.

The advantage of qubits is not only that it has a much larger information storage capacity than classical bits, but also that it is incomparable to classical bits in terms of information processing speed, especially when there are multiple bits. A system of n classical bits has a total of $2^n$ states.

### 1.4 Density Matrix Pure mixed state

The mixed state is composed of k different pure states $\psi_k$ according to a certain probability, and the average value of the mechanical quantities in the mixed state actually contains two averages, one is to average each pure state, and the other is to find a statistical average of different pure states.

### 1.5 Quantum entanglement

### 1.6 Quantum Implicit Transport Quantum unclonability theorem

## E1 Exercise 1

1.1. Prove that the eigenvalues of any Hermitian matrix are real numbers.

Answer: Let the Ermi matrix be A.

There is $A|\psi \rangle =\lambda |\psi\rangle$ and $\lambda$ as eigenvalues. Properties of the Ermi matrix: $A=A^\dagger$

Take Ermi on both sides at the same time: $\langle \psi|A^\dagger=\lambda^*\langle\psi|$

$$\langle\psi|A|\psi\rangle=\lambda^*\langle\psi|\psi\rangle$$

$\lambda$ is a constant, and we get $\lambda\langle\psi|\psi\rangle=\lambda^*\langle\psi|\psi\rangle$

So there is $\lambda=\lambda^*$

**1.2 Prove that the normalized eigenfunction corresponding to the non-degenerate eigenvalues of an arbitrary Hermitian operator forms a standard orthogonal basis vector. **

Answer: Let the Ermi matrix be A.

There is $A|\psi \rangle =\lambda |\psi\rangle$ and $\lambda$ as eigenvalues. Properties of the Ermi matrix: $A=A^\dagger$

$A|\psi_n \rangle =\lambda_n |\psi_n\rangle$,$\lambda_n$ is the eigenvalue and $\psi_n$ is the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_n$. Let m≠n.

In addition: $\langle \psi_m|A=\lambda_m\langle\psi_m|$

$$\langle\psi_m|A|\psi_n \rangle =\lambda_n \langle\psi_m|\psi_n\rangle$$

$$\lambda_m\langle\psi_m|\psi_n\rangle=\lambda_n\langle\psi_m|\psi_n\rangle$$

$\lambda_n,\lambda_m$ is a pair of non-degenerate eigenvalues, so there is $\langle\psi_m|\psi_n\rangle=0$

When $\lambda_n=\lambda_m$, the normalization condition $\langle\psi_n|\psi_n\rangle=1$

Thus, a standard orthogonal basis vector is formed by the normalized eigenfunction corresponding to the non-degenerate eigenvalues of any Hermitian operator.

1.3 Suppose one eigenvalue of the operator $\hat{A}$ is twice degenerate, meaning that there are two eigenvectors **$\hat{A} |n_1 \rangle = A_n |n_1 \rangle$ ** and **$\hat{A} |n_2 \rangle = A_n |n_2 \rangle$We can construct two orthogonal eigenvectors with linear transformations. The construction transformation is:**

$|n'_1 \rangle = |n_1 \rangle$ ** and **$|n'_2 \rangle = c |n_1 \rangle + |n_2 \rangle$ **given normalized **$|n_1 \rangle,|n_2 \rangle$ **, where c is the constant we need to solve. **

Answer: If you know $\langle n'_1 |n'_2\rangle=0$, then $\langle n_1| (c |n_1 \rangle + |n_2 \rangle)=0$,expand,$\langle n_1 |n_1\rangle=1,\langle n_1 |n_2\rangle=0$

c=0

1.4 Prove that if two Hermitian matrices are commuted, $[A,B]=0$, they have a complete set of common eigenfunctions.**

A: First of all, consider the case where both are only non-degeneracy.

Suppose both $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ have non-degenerate eigenvalues, i.e., their eigenvalues are unique, and each eigenvalue corresponds to a unique eigenvector.

Suppose the eigenvalues of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ are $\lambda_n$ and $\mu_n$, respectively, and each eigenvalue has a unique eigenvector. Namely:

$\hat{A} |n\rangle = \lambda_n |n\rangle, \quad \hat{B} |n\rangle = \mu_n |n\rangle$.

Since $[\hat{A}, \hat{B}] = 0$, we have:

$\hat{A} \hat{B} = \hat{B} \hat{A}$.

This means that when $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ act on the local eigenvector $|n\rangle$, the order does not affect the result. First, $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ are applied to the main vector $|n\rangle$:

$$\hat{A} \hat{B} |n\rangle = \hat{B} \hat{A} |n\rangle$$

Using eigenequations:

$\hat{A} \hat{B} |n\rangle = \hat{A} (\mu_n |n\rangle) = \mu_n \hat{A} |n\rangle = \mu_n \lambda_n |n\rangle$,

$\hat{B} \hat{A} |n\rangle = \hat{B} (\lambda_n |n\rangle) = \lambda_n \hat{B} |n\rangle = \lambda_n \mu_n |n\rangle$.

Therefore, we conclude that:

$$\mu_n \lambda_n |n\rangle = \lambda_n \mu_n |n\rangle$$

This suggests that $|n\rangle$ is a common eigenvector of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$.

Then consider the degeneracy of the two:

For cases with degenerate eigenvalues, assume that $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ have degenerate eigenvalues. For example, suppose that the eigenvalue $\lambda_n$ corresponding to $\hat{A}$ has a degeneracy k, i.e., there are k linearly independent eigenvectors $|n_1\rangle, |n_2\rangle, \dots, |n_k\rangle$ corresponding to $\lambda_n$.

In the k-dimensional subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda_n$, it is assumed that the action of $\hat{B}$ can map this subspace to itself, because $[\hat{A}, \hat{B}] = 0$, i.e., when $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ act on any vector in that subspace, their order is commutable.

For any two eigenvectors $|n_1\rangle$ and $|n_2\rangle$ in this k-dimensional subspace, we can construct a new eigenvector using the reciprocal relation $[\hat{A}, \hat{B}] = 0$. Consider linear transformations:

$$|n'_1\rangle = |n_1\rangle, \quad |n'_2\rangle = c |n_1\rangle + |n_2\rangle,$$

where c is the appropriate constant, ensuring that $|n'_1\rangle$ and $|n'_2\rangle$ are orthogonal and normalized. With such transformations, we can construct a common set of eigenvectors.Since we can construct a common set of eigenvectors in each degenerate subspace, and since both $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ are Hermitian matrices, these eigenvectors are orthogonal and complete. Thus, $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ have a complete set of eigenfunctions that are common throughout the space.

2. It is known that the two states **$|\psi_{1}\rangle$ ** and **$|\psi_{2}\rangle$ **form the standard orthogonal basis vector of the Hilbert space of a two-state system. We define a new base vector{**$\left|\phi_{1}\right\rangle$ **,**$\left|\phi_{2}\right\rangle$ **} as:**

$$|\phi_1\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1\rangle+|\psi_2\rangle)\text{ and }|\phi_2\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1\rangle-|\psi_2\rangle)$$

Operator**$\hat{A}$ **In the primordial vector:

$$\widehat{\mathcal{A}}=\begin{pmatrix}a&t\\t&b\end{pmatrix}$$

Find the matrix representation of this operator within the new base vector.**

A: First, solve the transition matrix.

Transfer Matrix:

$$S=\langle \psi_1,\psi_2|\phi_1,\phi_2\rangle=\langle \psi_1,\psi_2|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1\rangle+|\psi_2\rangle), \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_1\rangle-|\psi_2\rangle)\rangle$$

$$S=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{pmatrix}$$

$$A'=S^\dagger A S$$

Simplify it to:

$$A' = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{a+b}{2} + t & \frac{a-b}{2} \\ \frac{a-b}{2} & \frac{a+b}{2} - t \end{pmatrix}$$

3. We know that the Hamiltonian of spin in a magnetic field is

$$\widehat{H}=g\mu_B\boldsymbol{B}\cdot\widehat{\boldsymbol{S}}$$

where B is the magnetic field and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{S}}\equiv\frac12\boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}}$ is the spin vector operator. The g-factor is negative. **

**At the initial moment, the system is in the ground state: the spin is consistent with the magnetic field; At the moment the direction of the magnetic field suddenly turns the angle **$\theta$ **. Since the change is instantaneous, the wave function does not change at t=0, and it is no longer the eigenstate of the neo-Hamiltonian after the direction of the magnetic field changes. So we conclude that this is a non-trivial temporal change. Let's choose the z-axis as the new direction of the field, so the new Hamiltonian is **

$$\hat{H}=g\mu_BB\hat{S}\equiv\frac{E_z}2 \begin{pmatrix}-1&0 \\0&1 \end{pmatrix}$$

$E_z=|g|\mu_BB$ ** is the Zeeman energy, which is the difference between the upper and lower states of the spin.**

1. Assuming that the rotation is about the y-axis, find out the wave function in the basis vector representation.**
2. **Write the corresponding Schrödinger equation**
3. **Solve this Schrödinger equation with the initial conditions given in a**
4. Use the result in c to find the time-dependent expected value of $\langle S_x(t)\rangle$ and $\langle S_y(t)\rangle$
5. The initial conditions for the Heisenberg equations of motion for the export operator $\langle S_x \rangle$ S_y\rangle$ for the $\langle \rangle$ $\langle S_x\rangle$ and $\langle S_y\rangle$ are $\hat{S}_{x,y}(0)=\frac{1}{2}\hat{\sigma}_{x,y}$ .**
6. Using the fact that the wave function does not change in Heisenberg's landscape, i.e. it is the expression given in (a), find **$\langle S_x(t)\rangle$ ** and **$\langle S_y(t)\rangle$ **, and compare the answer to (d).**

Answer: Wave function

1. At the initial moment $t = 0$, the system is in the ground state where the spin is consistent with the direction of the magnetic field, i.e.:

$$\psi(0) = | \uparrow_z \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$According to the rotation operator in quantum mechanics, the rotation operator about the y-axis is:

$$R_y(\theta) = \exp\left(-i \frac{\theta}{2} \hat{\sigma}_y\right)$$

$$\hat{\sigma}_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

Thus, the new representation of the wave function after rotation is:

$$\psi(t) = R_y(\theta) \psi(0) = \exp\left(-i \frac{\theta}{2} \hat{\sigma}_y\right) \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

What the Compute Rotation Operator does:

$$R_y(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} & -\sin \frac{\theta}{2} \\ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} & \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \end{pmatrix}$$

Therefore, the wave function is:

$$\psi(t) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \\ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \end{pmatrix}$$

2. Schrödinger's equation

The Schrödinger equation is:

$$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(t) = \hat{H} \psi(t)$$

Substituting the given Hamiltonian in:

$$\hat{H} = \frac{E_z}{2} \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$$

We get the Schrödinger equation:

$$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(t) = \frac{E_z}{2} \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \psi_1(t) \\ \psi_2(t) \end{pmatrix}$$

Namely:

$$i \hbar \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial \psi_1(t)}{\partial t} \\ \frac{\partial \psi_2(t)}{\partial t} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{E_z}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -\psi_1(t) \\ \psi_2(t) \end{ pmatrix}$$

3. For the subsequent solution, we turn 2 into a component form:

Specific forms:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \begin{pmatrix} a(t) \\ b(t) \end{pmatrix} = \frac{E_z}{2} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a(t) \\ b(t) \end{pmatrix}.$$

Split into component forms:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial a(t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{E_z}{2} a(t), \quad i\hbar \frac{\partial b(t)}{\partial t} = \frac{E_z}{2} b(t).$$

Initial condition: $|\psi(0^+)\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{pmatrix}$ from step 1

For $a(t)$:$$\frac{\partial a(t)}{\partial t} = i\frac{E_z}{2\hbar}$$

The solution is:

$$a(t) = a(0^+) e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t}$$

For $b(t)$:

$$\frac{\partial b(t)}{\partial t} = -i\frac{E_z}{2\hbar} b(t)$$

The solution is:

$$b(t) = b(0^+) e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t}$$

So the wave function is:

$$|\psi(t)\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \end{pmatrix}$$

4.

operator $\hat{S}_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x$, where $\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. The expected value is calculated as:

$$\langle S_x(t) \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | \hat{S}_x | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi(t) | \sigma_x | \psi(t) \rangle$$

Expand the wave function for the following purposes:

$$\langle \psi(t) | \sigma_x | \psi(t) \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} & \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \end{pmatrix} \begin{ pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \end{ pmatrix}$$

Calculated:

$$\langle \psi(t) | \sigma_x | \psi(t) \rangle = \sin\theta \cos\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

Therefore:

$$\langle S_x(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \cos\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

operator $\hat{S}_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$, where $\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. The expected value is calculated as:

$$\langle S_y(t) \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | \hat{S}_y | \psi(t) \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi(t) | \sigma_y | \psi(t) \rangle$$

Expand the wave function for the following purposes:

$$\langle \psi(t) | \sigma_y | \psi(t) \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} & \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \end{pmatrix} \begin{ pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{-i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) e^{i \frac{E_z}{2\hbar} t} \end{pmatrix}$$

Calculated:

$$\langle \psi(t) | \sigma_y | \psi(t) \rangle = \sin\theta \sin\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

5. Heisenberg's equations of motionThe equations of motion of the operators $\hat{S}_x, \hat{S}_y$ are given by:

$$\frac{d\hat{O}_H}{dt} = \frac{i}{\hbar} [\hat{H}, \hat{O}_H]$$

where $\hat{H} = \frac{E_z}{2} \sigma_z$

For $\hat{S}_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x$

$$[\hat{H}, \hat{S}_x] = \frac{E_z}{2} \left[ \sigma_z, \sigma_x \right] = i E_z \sigma_y$$

$$\frac{d\hat{S}_x}{dt} = \frac{E_z}{\hbar} \hat{S}_y$$

For $\hat{S}_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$:

$$[\hat{H}, \hat{S}_y] = \frac{E_z}{2} \left[ \sigma_z, \sigma_y \right] = -i E_z \sigma_x$$

$$\frac{d\hat{S}_y}{dt} = -\frac{E_z}{\hbar} \hat{S}_x$$

The simultaneous equation is:

$$\frac{d\hat{S}_x}{dt} = \frac{E_z}{\hbar} \hat{S}_y, \quad \frac{d\hat{S}_y}{dt} = -\frac{E_z}{\hbar} \hat{S}_x$$

Second-order equation form:

$$\frac{d^2\hat{S}_x}{dt^2} + \left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar}\right)^2 \hat{S}_x = 0,\frac{d^2\hat{S}_y}{dt^2} + \left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar}\right)^2 \hat{S}_y = 0$$

The value of the operator at $t = 0$:

$$\hat{S}_x(0) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x, \quad \hat{S}_y(0) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y$$

6.

In Heisenberg's landscape, the operator $\hat{S}_x(t), \hat{S}_y(t)$ is solved as:

$$\hat{S}_x(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \cos\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

$$\hat{S}_y(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \sin\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

The expected values calculated in Schrödinger's painting are:

$$\hat{S}_x(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \cos\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

$$\hat{S}_y(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin\theta \sin\left(\frac{E_z}{\hbar} t\right)$$

The two results are completely consistent, which verifies the equivalence of Schrödinger's and Heisenberg's landscapes.

Exercise 4.5.6

## 2 Quantum Dynamics### 2.1 Three major painted scenes

Easescenes: It can be seen as a different frame of reference in quantum mechanics.

Schrödinger paints the scene: The temporal evolution of the system is placed in a time-dependent state wave function $|\psi\rangle$, and any physical quantity that does not appear to contain time is expressed by a linear operator without time.

In Schrödinger's picture, the average value of the mechanical quantities is:

$$\langle\hat{A}(t)\rangle\equiv\langle\psi(t)|\hat{A}|\psi(t)\rangle$$

Operator evolution over time:

$$\frac{\partial\langle A(t)\rangle}{\partial t}\equiv\left\langle\frac{\partial\psi(t)}{\partial t}\right|\hat{A}\left|\psi(t)\right\rangle+\left\langle\psi(t)\right|\hat{A}\left|\frac{\partial\psi(t)}{\partial t}\right \rangle$$

Bring in the Schrödinger equation: $\mathrm{i\hbar}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\mathrm{t}}=\hat{H}\psi$

This can be obtained: $\frac{\partial\langle A(t)\rangle}{\partial t}\equiv\frac i\hbar\langle\psi(t)|[\hat{H},\hat{A}]|\psi(t)\rangle$

PS: It can also be seen here that in quantum mechanics it is important to have a relationship of ease.

To introduce Heisenberg painting, we introduce the following relationships:

$$\Psi(x,t)=\hat{U}(t,t_0)\Psi(x,t_0)$$

Throw this chunk into the part above where the operator evolves over time, and define it:

$$\hat{A}_H(t)=\hat{U}^\dagger(t,t_0)\hat{A}\hat{U}(t,t_0)$$

Then the equation of motion can be written as:

$$\frac{\partial\hat{A}_H}{\partial t}\equiv\frac{\mathrm{i}}{\hbar}[\hat{H},\hat{A}_H]$$

There is a clear difference between Heisenberg's landscapes and Schrödinger's landscapes. The operators expressed by Schrödinger are constants, while quantum states evolve over time. Despite these differences, the two mattes are only different from the time-dependent substrates. The measurement statistics are exactly the same for both matte paintings.

However, in daily learning and scientific research, the most important feature of the use is that the wave function and time will change over time.

In order to obtain the transformation relationship between the mechanical quantities under the interactive landscape and the mechanical quantities under Schrödinger's landscape:

$$\hat{A}_I(t)=\widehat{U}_I^\dagger(t,0)\hat{A}\widehat{U}_I(t,0)$$

$$\widehat{H}_{2I}=\widehat{U}_I^\dagger(t,0)\widehat{H}_2\widehat{U}_I(t,0)$$

Let's see if we want to expand on this later

### 2.2 Temporal perturbation theory

When the theory is not included, you can see the notes on elementary quantum mechanics.

However, let's start with the theory of timeless perturbation:$$\widehat H=\hat H_0+\hat H^{\prime}$$

## E2 Exercise 2

**1. Prove that the first-order correction of the matrix element of the temporal evolution operator **$\langle m|\widehat{U}_{I}^{(1)}(0,-\infty)|n\rangle$ given in the theory of time-independent perturbation is equivalent to the equation **$c_{nm}^{(1)}=\frac{M_{mn}}{E_n^{(0)}-E_m^{(0)}} (n\neq m), c_{nn}^{(1). )}=0$ **$c_{nm}^{1}$ **, of course, remember that perturbation is applied during adiabatic process.**
