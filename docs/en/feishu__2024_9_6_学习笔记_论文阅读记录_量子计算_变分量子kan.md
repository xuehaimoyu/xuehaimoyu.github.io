# The quantum version of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network ( KAN ) : Variational Quantum KolmogorovArnold Network.

## Main content

We have implemented a quantum version of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) on a quantum circuit. It optimizes the weights of each synaptic connection to improve the overall performance of neurons. This approach greatly improves the efficiency of traditional neural networks because it can be optimized more accurately and requires only a few neurons to solve complex problems. KAN is a multi-layered network, similar to a traditional neural network, where each layer is represented as a matrix containing parameters and feedback. This structure is linear and reflects the form of variational quantum algorithms. Therefore, we propose a variational quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold network (VQKAN) as a quantum version of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. We demonstrate the optimization of VQKAN's fitting of a given function in some respects, e.g. by analysis and comparison.
