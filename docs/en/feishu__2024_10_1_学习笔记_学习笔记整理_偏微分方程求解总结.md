# **1 General**

The solution of partial differential equations is a very important problem in physics, and various physical problems are often solved after theoretical analysis and simplification, or in real application scenarios. Classical Newtonian equations, analytic mechanics equations, Maxwell's equations, and Schrödinger's equations can all be classified as partial differential equations (PDEs). The most widely used in mathematics, physics and engineering technology are second-order partial differential equations, and it has even become customary to call these equations mathematical physical equations.

To solve a practical physical problem, it is necessary to establish a mathematical model according to the laws of physics, derive the generalized equation, and then solve it according to the initial value condition, boundary condition and other solution conditions. Of course, when solving a solution to a partial differential equation, three problems must be studied: the existence of the solution, the uniqueness, and the stability.

This special research mainly sorts out the various solutions to partial differential equations that I am currently teaching in this semester and my own understanding, mainly sorting out traditional analytical methods, common numerical calculation methods, and deep learning methods (focusing on the latter two) to solve and calculate partial differential equations, and interspersed with some examples of graphing, all of which are written by me using Python.

# 2 Traditional Parsing Methods

This section mainly introduces the more classical and traditional mathematical analytical solutions, but the scope of application is very limited, and it is difficult to give numerical expressions for most of the results. This section mainly includes two commonly used methods: the separation variable method and the integral transformation method. Although the methods are different, the goal of the two methods is to reduce the dimensionality of partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations to solve them, and in Chapter 3, we choose to introduce the numerical method of solving ordinary differential equations as a supplement to the analytical method.

## 2.1 Separation of variables

Core: Partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations

The basic idea is to first find a special solution in the form of a separated variable that satisfies the boundary conditions, and then give a linear superposition of the solution according to the superposition principle, and determine the undetermined coefficient by the solution condition

Critical Step: Solve the eigenvalue problem.

According to different coordinate systems, different coordinate systems can be separated, and the core of this is the expression of the Laplace operator in different coordinate systems1. Cartesian coordinate system

$$\nabla ^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$$

2. Cylindrical coordinate system

$ \nabla ^2=\frac{1}{\rho } \frac{\partial }{\partial \rho} (\rho\frac{\partial }{\partial \rho})+\frac{1}{\rho^2 } \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \varphi ^2}+ \frac{\partial^2}{\ partial z^2}$ 

3. Spherical coordinate system

Generally, the ball with good symmetry can be divided into two parts: radial and angular:

$\nabla ^2=\frac{1}{R^2}\frac{\partial }{\partial R}(R^2\frac{\partial }{\partial R}) +\frac{1}{R^2\sin \theta}{\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} }(\sin \theta \frac{\partial }{\ partial \theta} )+\frac{1}{R^2\sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \varphi ^2}$  

### 2.1 Example 1: Solving the wave function of a hydrogen atom

The solution of the wave function of hydrogen atom is one of the few results in quantum mechanics that can be solved accurately, and it also clearly demonstrates the application of the separation variable method in it

The stationary Schrödinger equation for hydrogen atoms in a spherical coordinate system can be written as:

$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}(r^2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} +\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{1}{\sin \theta} \frac{\partial }{\partial \theta}(\sin \ theta\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta} )+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial \phi ^2)}]+V\psi=0$ 

Due to the V-sphere symmetry, consider using the separation variable method such that $\psi(r,\theta,\phi)=R(r)Y(\theta,\phi)$

Substituting the original equation for simplification, the form is {}+{}=0, the former term is only related to r, and the latter term is only related to $\theta$, $\psi$, so each term must be a constant.

Break down the original equation into radial and angular equations:

Radial Equation:

$$-\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\mathrm{d} r^2} +[-\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon _0}\frac{1}{r}+\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2} ]u=uE$$

$$(u=rR(r))$$

Angular equation:

$$\sin \theta\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta} (\sin \theta\frac{\partial Y}{\partial \theta} )+ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2}=-l(l+1)\sin^2\theta Y$$Angular equations can be separated using a similar approach.

Finally, we can get the normalized wave function of the hydrogen atom:

$$\psi _{nlm}=\sqrt{(\frac{2}{na})^3\frac{(n-l-1)!} {2n[(n+l)!] ^3} }e^{-r/na}(\frac{2r}{na} )^l[L_{n-l-1}^{2l+1}(2r/na)]Y_l^m(\theta,\phi )$$

$$Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)=\varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-|m|)!} {4\pi(l+|m|)!} }e^{im\phi}P_l^m(\cos \theta)$$

### **2.1.2 Summary**

The dissociative variable method is the most commonly used method for solving common partial differential equations and simplifying them.

For the solution of non-homogeneous equations and non-homogeneous boundary conditions, the solution of non-homogeneous boundary conditions is generally converted to homogeneous first, and then the eigenfunction expansion method is used to solve the problem.

## **2.2 Integral Transformation Method**

The integral transformation method is also an important method for solving mathematical physics equations, which is suitable for solving unbounded regions and semi-unbounded regions. The core idea is to reduce the number of independent variables through integral transformations until they are reduced to ordinary differential equations.    

There are two common integral transformations, one is the Fourier transform and the other is the Lagrangian transformation.

Fourier transform:

$F[f(x)]=\tilde{f} (k)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-ikx}dx$ (Fourier positive transform)

$F^{-1}[\tilde{f} (k)]=f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\tilde{f} (k)e^{ikx}dk$ (inverse Fourier transform)

The Fourier transform requires that the function to be transformed is defined in infinite intervals, that the Dirichlet condition is satisfied in any finite interval, and that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(t)|dt$ exists.

However, this is more restrictive, so the Rasl transform is introduced:

$$L[f(p)]=\bar{f} (p)=\int_0^{\infty}f(t)e^{-pt}dt$$

$$L^{-1}[\bar{f}(p)]=f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma -i\infty}^{\sigma +i\infty}\bar{f}(p)e^{pt}dp$$

In the process of solving specific problems, the properties of Fourier transform and pull transform are often used to simplify. The overall idea is to transform the initial value of the original function into an image function through transformation, find the image function through the property simplification equation, and finally obtain the original function through the inverse transformation.

Here we will take the 3D Poisson equation as an example, and at the same time familiarize yourself with some techniques of drawing.
