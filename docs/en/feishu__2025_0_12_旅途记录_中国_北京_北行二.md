# Northbound II

> This time I had to think of an inscription, and this one came to mind

But the inscription seems a bit hasty to write like this, so there is the following article:

> Replies are visible

If I had to sum up winter in Beijing in one word, I would choose loneliness.

12.29 I finally completed the record of the first trip to the north, and at the beginning of 2025, I told myself that I could not delay writing the travelogue any longer.

Peking Man

The second trip to Beijing, 5 days of work, 2 days of travel, a beginning and an end.

## Shunyi

The story starts with landing in the capital T2, staying in Shunyi, and experiencing a week of work.

(The following is limited by confidentiality regulations, omitting 5000 words, probably not because I want to be lazy)

For the first time, I have my own big workstation, two big monitors, and the efficiency is scary. (Mainly because I don't have any work, so I can only do my own projects)

On the first day of employment, I introduced myself at the company's large group meeting. The first experience of working from 9 to 6 in the morning, getting to know colleagues, eating with colleagues, fishing together, arriving late and leaving early together.

So in the company's team building, the first time I drank alcohol, the first time I went to KTV, although my heart was refusal, but I always felt that I needed to get out of my comfort zone and experience a different way of life. Anyway, I'm still very happy, but I still don't want to go to KTV and business dinners in the future.

During the week, I felt great benefits, great colleagues, and a great working environment, but would this be the life I wanted?

It always feels like I need to experience more.

## Forbidden City

Half a year after looking at the Forbidden City in Jingshan, I finally walked in from the noon gate openly.

Of course, because it is the imperial capital + weekend, although it is the off-season, in the case that the subway station in Tiananmen Square is blocked and cannot get out, you can only enter through Donghua Gate.

Ducks by the lake

Winter in the north is different from the south, a little greenery is rare, and the ducks by the lake add a bit of vitality to this bleak autumn, with a variety of crowds, it is very lively.

As soon as I entered the Forbidden City, I was dazzled by the huge building complex, and from the current point of view, this is probably the most unlivable place, and when walking in the garden is like a marathon, it is troublesome to look at.

<img src="/assets/FjuhbT9tnoRU7Kx0QLDcbwXVnth.jpeg" src-width="2304" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1728" align="center"/>

There are also many creatures in the Forbidden City, which makes the inner courtyard of this deep palace no longer so barren and lonely.

Old eagles, magpies and stone lions

Speaking of the Forbidden City, in addition to the historical buildings, the most impressive nature is the dazzling array of treasures.

Ironically, the treasures that the emperors of the past generations worked so hard to collect ended up outliving much longer than them. No matter how strong the wind and clouds are, it is no more than a cup of loess. Not even as good as a stone.

How many things in ancient and modern times are laughing and talking

On the contrary, these round and jade cans show a higher value and reflect the superb skill of the creator.

Cat's Eye (Crystal Ball)

In a sense, these craftsmen outlived the emperor.

When the paper on which the words are written forgets the meaning of the words, when the word of mouth tells the deep meaning of the story, when the tone of daily communication forgets the rhythm of the past, when everything is not submerged in the long river of time, only the cans made of stone remain, and the story ends here.

But there are always people who like to dig up these stories, understand the joys and sorrows of the people of that era, record the traces of their existence, and so on.

Maybe after the heat death of the universe, there will be a detached observer who will record everything in this universe.

Collecting these stories is also one of the great pleasures of traveling, and that's one of the reasons why I love traveling.

Set off with your bag on your back, encounter different scenery, meet different people, and listen to different stories.

Far from it.

Return to the Forbidden City.

The crowd stood at the center of the former imperial power, which may be one of the meanings of the struggle more than 100 years ago.

(But to charge tickets, the treasure hall is crowded, you can only take a look)

Qianqing Gate and Qianqing Palace

It can be seen that everyone is still more interested in where the emperor sleeps and how to play.

<img src="/assets/OBPwbYrgEoqaknxDKkDcnMXLn9s.jpeg" src-width="3456" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="4608" align="center"/>

There is also an arrow cluster inserted on the plaque of Longzongmen, which is very historical and indicates the occurrence of big events.

But I feel that the suspicion of bragging is quite big, and in the Forbidden City, which is strictly hierarchical, I can't even afford to change a plaque?

Entertainment

## Eat

There is a fate to meet thousands of miles away, meet old acquaintances in other places, and be very happy to eat a pot of shabu-shabu. I chatted a little and was inspired a lot.

After a few days, I decided to take a moment to re-examine myself and step out of my comfort zone.

Life is fun because it's unplanned.

I am so curious, and I clearly know the value of life and time, but I often hesitate because of unplanned.

May I no longer cower because of timidity and inferiority in the future, because there is still scenery to look forward to.

By the Way, Peking duck is really fragrant.

## City Walk

After experiencing a traffic jam in the capital, on the last afternoon, I decided to open City Walk according to a friend's suggestion.

Start with the alley

<img src="/assets/UXH1bokhdouOcLxsAI4crcpMnof.jpeg" src-width="3456" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="4608" align="center"/>

All the way to the White Pagoda Temple (?) Forward.

There was a smell of the New Year in the community.

<img src="/assets/RNpKbzD6Do079TxeYvGcGGwQnCh.jpeg" src-width="2304" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="1728" align="center"/>

But it's not the old Beijing New Year's flavor as imagined.

<img src="/assets/CL2wbwPB7odLRVx4Z5Ycudijndg.jpeg" src-width="4608" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="3456" align="center"/>There is an endless stream of "literary and artistic youths" who check in and take pictures on social media, and this place is quite outstanding.

But there is no New Year's flavor of old Beijing.

### White Pagoda Temple

<img src="/assets/VSQUbwqIhoOD0QxxL9ucY7NVnhg.jpeg" src-width="4608" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="3456" align="center"/>

There are no photos of 🧐 the White Pagoda at the White Pagoda Temple

It is very reasonable, because the temple does not have a complete white pagoda.

### Temple of the Emperors of the Ages

At first glance, it looks like the tombs of the emperors of the past dynasties, but it turns out that there are all tablets (it doesn't seem to be bad).

In the 21st century, all sacrifices are made of fakes.

### Geological Museum of China

The museum, there is nothing to say, there are really many ores in it.

But it feels better than the one in the Hat Tianshan.

### Zhengyang Bookstore

Favorite place for Citywalk this time.

I went straight to the roast duck restaurant when I left the Geological Museum, but I accidentally came across this place.

Life really needs a little adventure, and travel always needs to be explored.

Unplanned surprises, always fascinating.

## Postscript

I experienced a different life, photographed the starry sky in different regions, and met different travelers.

I was able to eat what I wanted to eat, I met my friends I wanted to meet, I experienced the long-awaited heating, and I was able to take the photos I wanted.

ps1: It's still too tired to eat half a roast duck alone, and I'm tired of writing a blog at the moment. Friends are indeed the species that should be cherished the most.

Great one to the north.
