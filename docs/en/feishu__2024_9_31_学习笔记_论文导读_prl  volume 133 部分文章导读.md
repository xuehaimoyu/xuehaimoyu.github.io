### Effects of Colliding Laser Pulses Polarization on ùëí‚àí‚Å¢ùëí+ Cascade Development in Extreme Focusing

Summary:

The initiation and development of the electron-positron cascade requires tight focus in order to achieve maximum laser intensity in standing waves formed by multiple colliding laser pulses. There, a steep space-time gradient of laser intensity expels seed particles from areas of high intensity, which prevents the cascade reaction from occurring. We show that the radially polarized laser pulses ensure that the seed electrons are present in the focal plane at the moment of highest amplitude, even in the case of extreme focusing. This feature reduces the laser power required for cascade initiation by a factor of 100 (80x) compared to circularly (linear) polarized laser pulses with the same focal spot radius and duration. `

Quantum many-body systems undergoing phase transitions are proposed as detectors to achieve sensing accuracy enhancement that surpasses the classical one. However, this enhancement is usually limited to a very narrow area near the tipping point. Here, we systematically develop a modular approach to introduce multiple phase transitions in multibody systems. This naturally allows us to expand the region of quantum-enhanced precision by covering the newly created phase boundaries. Our method is universal and can be applied to symmetry-breaking and topological quantum sensors. In symmetry-breaking sensors, we show that newly created critical points inherit the original universal categories, and that simple measurements of total magnetization are sufficient to determine their position. In topology sensors, our modular construction creates multiple bands, resulting in a rich phase diagram. In both cases, the Heisenberg scaling estimated by the Hamiltonian parameter is achieved at all phase boundaries. This can be leveraged to create a global sensor that performs significantly better than a homogeneous probe.

Abstract:Distributed quantum computing is a promising computing paradigm capable of performing computations beyond the capabilities of a single quantum device. In distributed quantum computing, privacy is essential to maintain confidentiality and protect data under untrusted computing nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel blind quantum machine learning protocol based on the quantum bilateral correlator algorithm. Our protocol protects data privacy from untrusted parties while reducing communication overhead. We have introduced robust algorithm-specific privacy protections with low computational overhead and without the need for complex cryptography. Subsequently, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocol through complexity and privacy analysis. Our research results pave the way for the development of distributed quantum computing, opening up new possibilities for privacy-conscious machine learning applications in the era of quantum technology.

### Simulating Noisy Variational Quantum Algorithms: A Polynomial Approach

Variational quantum algorithm for analog noise: a polynomial approach<img src="/assets/CiuUbxWxSo6K5Rxgth1cXK2BnEu.png" src-width="500" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="329" align="center"/>

Large-scale variational quantum algorithms are widely recognized as a potential way to achieve real-world quantum advantage. However, the presence of quantum noise may undermine these advantages, blurring the boundaries of classical simulability. To further clarify this issue, we propose a novel polynomial-level method based on observable measurements of backpropagation path integral (OBPPP) on Pauli paths. In the presence of single-qubit Pauli noise, this method can effectively approximate the expected value of the operator in the variational quantum algorithm with a bounded truncation error. Theoretically, we rigorously prove: (i) For a constant minimum non-zero noise rate Œ≥, the temporal and spatial complexity of the OBPPP is polynomially related to the number of qubits n and the circuit depth L. (ii) for variable noise rate Œ≥, in the presence of more than two non-zero noise factors, the complexity remains Poly(n,L) if the Œ≥ is greater than 1/logL; However, when the Œ≥ is less than 1/L, the complexity increases exponentially with L. Numerically, we perform a classical simulation of the results of zero-noise extrapolation experiments on IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor [Y. Kim et al., "Evidence of the Utility of Quantum Computing Before Fault Tolerance", Nature (London) 618, 500 (2023)). Compared to quantum devices, our method has demonstrated better performance in terms of accuracy and runtime. In addition, our method allows for the simulation of noise results, enabling accurate reproduction of IBM unmitigated experimental results that directly correspond to the original experimental observations. Our research reveals the critical role of noise in classical simulations, and the method is universal in calculating the expected value of a wide range of quantum circuits, which can be applied to the verification of quantum computers.

### Efficient Characterization of Qudit Logical Gates with Gate Set Tomography Using an Error-Free Virtual ùëç Gate Mode

Gate set tomography (GST) is used to characterize the process matrices of quantum logic gates, taking into account measurement and state preparation errors in quantum processors. GST typically requires a lot of data collection and significant computational resources to estimate the model. We propose a more efficient GST method for multi-level systems (qudits), using multi-level Hadama gates and virtual Z-gates to construct benchmarks, while assuming that the virtual Z-gates are correct. Our approach reduces the computational cost of estimating characterization results, making GST more practical on a larger scale. We experimentally demonstrated the applicability of this method on the superconducting transmitter qutrit.

### Entropy Bounds for Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution with Local Bell Test

Entropy bounds versus local Bell tests in device-independent quantum key distribution

One of the main challenges in device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is to achieve the required Bell violation over long distances, as channel loss results in lower overall detection efficiency. Recent studies have explored the concept of certifying non-local associations over longer distances through local Bell testing. In this scheme, additional quantum devices are placed near one side, and short-range correlation is used to verify non-local behavior over long distances. However, existing studies either fail to address the issue of DIQKD security in this setting, especially for active attackers, or adopt methods that do not give a tight bounds on the key rate. In this study, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate calculation task in this setting, combined with the most recent methods used to analyze standard DIQKD. With this approach, we show that if the short-range device has a sufficiently high detection efficiency, it is possible to achieve a positive key rate at a lower detection efficiency in long-distance branches than with a standard DIQKD setup. This highlights the potential of DIQKD to improve its performance at long distances in scenarios where short-range correlations are used to verify quantum correlations.

We introduce the task of shadow process simulation, with the goal of simulating the estimation of the expected value of an arbitrary quantum observable measurement at the output of the target physical process. When the sender and receiver share random bits or other signal-free resources, we demonstrate that shadow process simulation outperforms traditional process simulation protocols in a variety of scenarios, including communication, noise simulation, and data compression. Notably, we found that there were scenarios where shadow simulations provided greater statistical accuracy without increasing the required sample size.

### Generalized Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Non-Gaussian Interactions

Generalized dynamic mean field theory for non-Gaussian interactions

<img src="/assets/PBPobNLmEoo98CxpCB0cAkPOnNe.png" src-width="500" class="markdown-img m-auto" src-height="323" align="center"/>
We propose a generalized dynamic mean-field theory to study the effects of non-Gaussian instantaneous noise in general dynamic systems. We apply this framework to the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation, a central model in theoretical ecology in which interspecies interactions are fixed and heterogeneous in time. Our results show that the solution of the new mean field equation depends on all the accumulations of the species interaction distribution. When the interaction coupling showed a Œ±-stable distribution, we obtained an analytical solution and found a relationship between the species abundance distribution and the microscopic interaction statistics. In the case of sparse interactions (which we conducted analytical studies), we established a simple relationship between the interaction distribution and the population density distribution.
