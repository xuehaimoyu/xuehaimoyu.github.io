# The Bund-Lujiazui Travel Notes

The Bund-Lujiazui is a must-see classic attraction in Shanghai.

——— roommate in Shanghai

I have been to Shanghai for 4 years, and I have been there many times, to be honest, only the first time I went to play, and the next few times I went to play with others. But every time I see it, I am still amazed. So I took the opportunity of the blog update to write a record and organize the photos.

(PS: Except for some aerial photos, other photos are downloaded from QQ albums, and the picture quality is average.) ）

According to Mr. Junior High School, a good beginning is very important, so I started with aerial photos and experiences.

## Lujiazui

The idea of aerial photography of the Bund-Lujiazui was born from the moment I got the drone, but there was little time for cooking, and I didn't have the opportunity to show my strength until the senior year in 2024. Since the Bund is a no-fly zone, after carefully studying the no-fly map, I decided to try my luck by taking off in the direction of Lujiazui first.

When you come to Lujiazui, a three-piece set is indispensable. The Lujiazui Three-Piece Suite in Pudong, Shanghai, is composed of the 492-meter-tall Shanghai World Financial Center, the 420.5-meter-tall Shanghai Jin Mao Tower, and the 632-meter-tall Shanghai Tower.

(To tell the truth, I thought it contained the Oriental Pearl)

## The Bund

There is nothing wrong with going to the Bund to see the heads.

The clouds are deep and I don't know where

It's still the Bund

A good picture of a drone for a lifetime

I would like to commemorate the first drone I bought with my scholarship.
