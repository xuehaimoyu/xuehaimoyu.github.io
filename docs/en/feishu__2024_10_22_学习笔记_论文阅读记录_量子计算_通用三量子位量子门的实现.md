# Implementation of a universal three-qubit quantum gate

Article Links:

It is proved that a universal three-qubit quantum logic gate can be implemented using up to 98 single-bit revolving gates and 40 CNOT gates on the y- and z-axes instead of the previous 64 CNOT gates.

## Notation

$$\quad X=\sigma_x,\quad Y=\sigma_y,\quad Z=\sigma_z,\quad H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}$$

$$N(a,b,c)=\exp\left(i(a XXZ+b YYZ+c ZZZ)\right)$$

$$M(a,b,c,d)=\exp\left(i(a XXX+b YYX+c ZZX+d IIX)\right)$$

## Khaneja-Glaser decomposition

Any 1 three-bit gate can be broken down into the form shown in the figure

$U_j=N(a_j,b_j,c_j)$ and $V=M(a,b,c,d)$

So the following is how to disassemble these two things:

N can be split into this form:

And V can be disassembled into this form:

Substituting this, taking into account the absorption of the gate, theorem 1 is proposed

## Theorem 1Each unitary operation on a pair of three-qubits can be computed by a circuit consisting of up to 98 single-bit qubit phase gates and rotations around the y- and z-axes, as well as 40 CNOT gates.

Supplement: Each two-qubit unary operation can be computed with up to 15 basic one-qubit gates and 3 CNOT gates
